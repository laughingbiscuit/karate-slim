# Karate Slim

I love BDD. I don't really like Java. I don't mind 'technical' feature files, even though
a they aren't _strictly_ in business language that can be understood by all 
three amigos. I love apickli for this, but I hate deprecated dependencies and
am sad that the node request library was deprecated. I also dislike fixing deprecated
dependencies because modern node http client libraries are es6 modules.

So here we are.

Wouldn't it be nice if we could just write feature files again and forget
about the low level details?

This project bootstraps a Karate Java project and injects your feature files. Let's
get back to focusing on tests and not plumbing.
